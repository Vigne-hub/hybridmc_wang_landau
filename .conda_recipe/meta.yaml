requirements:
  build:
    - {{ compiler('cxx') }}  # Needed for compiling C++ code
    - cmake  # For running CMake scripts
    - ninja  # Build system used by CMake for faster builds
    - python <=3.11  # Python is needed for running setup.py
    - setuptools  # setuptools is required for setup.py
    - pybind11  # Include in build as pybind11 headers are needed at compile time

  host:
    - boost  # Your project links against Boost, so it needs to be in the host to be found by CMake
    - hdf5  # Similarly, HDF5 needs to be in the host to link against it
    - python <=3.11 # Ensure Python version matches for ABI compatibility
    - pybind11  # Include in host as project links against pybind11
